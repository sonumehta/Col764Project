# Col764Project
IR system for biomedical search:
Our goal is to build an information retrieval system for biomedical research. For the purpose of this project, we limit our analyses to one disease Covid-19 and use Covid-19 Open Research Dataset for all our analyses. Given a query related to covid-19, we want to retrieve a set of documents/research papers relevant to the query. As part of this dataset, we have access to the fullbody of the research papers. We train baseline models such as VSM, OkapiBM25, AWD-LSTM, roBERTa and Distilled roBERTa based model using the entire dataset and evaluate the performance on a set of 50 queries provided by in the Cord-19 Open Research Dataset. We then compare its performance with an Extreme Classification model (SiameseXML). SiameseXML model is trained using just the titles of the research papers and related papers as input data for an auxiliary task as described in Section 8 which generates embeddings for each token in the vocabulary. We then use these embeddings to embed both the research paper(title) and the query and use nearest neighbour search to retrieve the relevant papers for a query.
This repository contains code for various experiments that we performed on the Cord19 dataset.
